## My Work
I am a 4th year PhD student in Statistics at the University of Pittsburgh, where I work under [Lucas Mentch](http://lucasmentch.com/index.html). I primarily work developing inferential procedures for statistical learning techniques, and focus on applications of those methods to the environmental sciences. During my PhD studies, I've been lucky enough to work at the Air Force Research Lab, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, and most recently at Los Alamos National Lab. 
 
 My CV can be found [here](Tim_Coleman_CV_2020.pdf).

 
### Preprints/Publications
Below are links to my publicly available work:

[A Space Weather Paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2017SW001788?casa_token=j01gjgwkJA8AAAAA%3AVJbBuH5_GPeTk7iV3Q1MYFJZC3jvcf5GuE2uB_-n2-lMYKpHN_1maMoxY8pn761VzLI_3h16n5hQxg&) done with some collaborators at the Air Force Research Lab, where we use a Kalman Filter to fit a dynamic linear model to forecast electron flux levels in the upper magnetosphere.

[An F-test for Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07830.pdf) - the main focus of my PhD work. The goal is to conduct variable importance by comparing predictive accuracy of different random forests via a permutation test that is able to avoid costly variance estimates by exploiting the structure of random forests.

[Covariate Shifted Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09967) - motivated by the problem of forecasting hurricane outages during particularly extreme storms, this work proposes an importance sampling modification to standard random forest models. 

[Application of Random Forest Inference Procedures to Tree Swallow Migrations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09793.pdf) - using data from the [eBird project](https://ebird.org/home), we study the association between seasonal temperature patterns and bird occurrence.

## About Me

<img src="TC_Headshot.png" alt="Here I am!" width="100" align = "right"/>

I recieved my Bachelors with majors in Applied Math and Geography from Colgate University in 2016. Born in the UK, grew up in California, and currently struggling through winters in Pittsburgh, PA, while still spending some time out in New Mexico. I love to run (when I'm not actually running, of course), hike, and generally explore wherever I happen to be!
