## My work

Below are links to my publically available work:

[A Space Weather Paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2017SW001788?casa_token=j01gjgwkJA8AAAAA%3AVJbBuH5_GPeTk7iV3Q1MYFJZC3jvcf5GuE2uB_-n2-lMYKpHN_1maMoxY8pn761VzLI_3h16n5hQxg&) done with some collaborators at the Air Force Research Lab, where we use a Kalman Filter to fit a dynamic linear model to forecast electron flux levels in the upper magnetosphere.

[An F-test for Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07830.pdf) - the main focus of my PhD work. The goal is to conduct variable importance by comparing predictive accuracy of different random forests via a permutation test.

[Covariate Shifted Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09967) - motivated by the problem of forecasting hurricane outages during particularly extreme storms, this work proposes an importance sampling modification to standard random forest models. 

[Application of Random Forest Inference Procedures to Tree Swallow Migrations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09793.pdf) - using data from the [eBird project](https://ebird.org/home). 


## About Me

<img src="TC_Headshot.png" alt="Here I am!" width="120" align = "right"/>

I am a 4th year PhD student in Statistics at the University of Pittsburgh, where I work on developing inferential procedures for statistical learning techniques, and focus on applications of those methods to the environmental sciences. My CV can be found [here](Tim_Coleman_CV_Summer2019.pdf)  .
